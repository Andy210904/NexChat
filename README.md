# Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project for analyzing customer reviews and determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each review. This repository provides a complete pipeline for preprocessing text data, training sentiment analysis models, and evaluating their performance on customer review datasets.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenizing, and vectorizing customer reviews.
- **Model Training:** Supports various machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.
- **Prediction:** Easy-to-use scripts for inferring sentiment from new reviews.
- **Extensible:** Modular codebase for quick experimentation and integration of new models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Andy210904/Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    cd Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**  
   Place your customer review data (CSV or TXT format) in the `data/` directory.

2. **Preprocess the data:**  
   Use the provided preprocessing scripts or notebooks to clean and tokenize your data.

3. **Train a model:**  
   Run the training scripts or Jupyter notebooks to train and evaluate sentiment analysis models.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data data/reviews.csv --model logistic_regression
   ```

4. **Predict sentiment on new reviews:**  
   Use the prediction script to infer sentiment:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input "This product is amazing!"
   ```

5. **Visualize results:**  
   Use the visualization tools in the `notebooks/` folder for analysis and insights.
